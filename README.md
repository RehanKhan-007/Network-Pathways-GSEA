# Network-Pathways-GSEA
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disorder with a significant genetic component. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the genetic factors contributing to T2DM using a multi-faceted approach encompassing gene expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and network analysis. We analyzed GSE76894 dataset from GEO, comprising 103 samples, to identify key genes associated with T2DM. We initially conducted comprehensive gene expression analysis on the GSE76984 dataset, identifying a subset of 72 genes exhibiting differential expression, with 30 upregulated and 42 downregulated genes. Further investigation involved employing GeneNet analysis to elucidate hub genes through correlation analyses, highlighting intergenic relationships. We constructed a partial correlation network of gene interactions based on significant correlations, controlling for multiple testing issues with false discovery rate (FDR) estimation. The analysis revealed NEUROD1, ANGPTL2, FFAR4, and AHR as hub genes significantly associated with T2DM. Subsequent visualization of gene expression data via boxplots and scatter plots provided insights into gene expression patterns across different samples. Gene-variant network analysis demonstrated relationships between genes and their associated variants, with a nested circle layout providing a clear representation of these connections. Additionally, variant consequence type analysis revealed the distribution of variant types across all genes.
